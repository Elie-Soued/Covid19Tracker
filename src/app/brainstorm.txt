Chart.js issue : The chart is updating only on Window Resize
============================================================

I am building a Covid19 Tracker, and I would like to display the data that I am getting from an api
in a chart ( I am using the chart.js library).

This is the architecture of my app

<app-component>
    <navBar></navBar>
    <chart></chart>
</app-component>


The navBar Component 
--------------------
-Takes the following inputs :Country, date Range, Cases (deaths,recovered,confirmed)
-Sends a requests to the api with these inputs
-Sends the api response to the Canvas Component.


The Chart Component (has one job)
---------------------------------
-Display the data


First of all: check when the data is arriving to The Chart component.
